# portfolio-website
Alina first portfolio website

## Description

In this project I had opportunities to practice my my skills in front end dev and to built my firs pportofolio.

 ## Table content

 During this work I worked with the following:

- [HTML](#html)
- [CSS](#css)
- The command line, also known as the terminal,Git and GitHub

## HTML

I used semantic HTML to create my portfolio webpage.


## CSS

 I used  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), to add style to my  webpage.
 This is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.
 In this step I used:               
-  CSS variables
- CSS flex box
- Costum background colors
- Costum font size,  color
- various CSS selectors like tag, class, child, combined
- CSS responsive design using Media Query

 
When the page is loaded the page presents my name, and links to  
- sections:
    - [about me](#about-me) 
    - [work and education](#work-and-education) 
    - [contact me](#contact-me) 


* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

* When viewing the section about my work and education you can see carousel-images 

* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## About-Me

This section contanis information text about me.

## Work-and-Education

When viewing the section about my work and education you can see carousel-images that contain info and links about my work and education and my projects.
